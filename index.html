The exhibition featured a table with the riso-prints, a print-out of the thesis “Speculating Towards a Transversal Environmental Science,” and other related printed matter, a wall projection of the animated, spinning globe and three prints mounted on the wall.
The printed poster formed the foundation of a workshop that occurred on September 13. 2025, where interested participants gathered around the table to draw and paint over the apocalyptic landscape depicted in the climate graphics, adding blues and greens to represent a future worth living in and fighting for.</p>

                <div class="h1">Abstract</div>
                <p>While the threat of climate change has been scientifically understood for over fifty years, fossil investments and emissions continue climbing, jeopardizing progress towards renewable economies or lifestyle adjustments. For just as long, feminist and critical theorists have insisted on a situated perspective in science, to combat ‘objective’ scientific conclusions being put to work for naturalising and reproducing violent regimes and relations to the world. In the context of climate change, situated and reflexive paradigms are important for learning to inhabit the world on principles of care and kinship. But climate policy continues to insist on ‘pure’, objective science, in doing so denying the relevance of different relations to the world. The author reflects on the lack of such sensibilities in his environmental system science education, and speculates towards a transversal environmental science paradigm on the principles of embodiment, curiosity, humility and responsibility.</p>
                <div class="h1">Preface: Fury Between Academia and Activism</div>
            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>When I began my academic education seven years ago, what I brought with me was fury: I was angry over the state of the world. I had learned of the multifaceted injustices that national and global governing regimes perpetuate in the context of my work with the megafon newspaper collective<sup>1</sup> and left political activism in Bern, Switzerland; climate justice, antifascism, migrant solidarity, BLM, women's rights, Rojava. Though my privileged upbringing and white-masculine appearance shielded me from experiencing much of it first-hand, I was raised with humility and tenderness, which instilled in me the importance of solidarity and the possibility for achieving a better world.</p>
                <p>I was socialized in a political landscape that championed science as the exclusive basis for rational decision-making. Thus, intent on making a positive difference with regard to climate change, I signed up for the environmental system science<sup>2</sup> curriculum at the ETH Zürich. I believed it would supply me with the proper tools to encounter this world, ripe with inequality and injustice while environmental devastation looms for all earthlings on the fast approaching horizon.</p>
                <p>This education was very formative and instructive, but it also profoundly confused my political passion: Politics had little space in analytical, natural science after all. My classmates, I gather, were in a similar place. We would skip classes in favour of going to climate strikes, only to return to the library late and catch up on class. It is not that the institute for environmental system science wasn't welcoming of this political action: On the contrary, the atrium of the environmental system science building was often the site for painting strike banners and drawing signs. Nonetheless, I remember my suspicions over the doctrinaire division of science and politics in the curriculum; the imperative was to appear pure and value-neutral, even as we all had no illusions about why we were studying environmental system science.</p>
                <p>After three semesters of regimented schedule consisting almost exclusively of natural science classes, the possibility to sign up for electives made available new lenses for understanding what was going on. In the ETH Zürich's humanities department I found a critical language for investigating my suspicions; one that aligned much better with my embodied, activist knowledge and facilitated an interrogation of the natural science that I once looked up to for answers. With it I found my fury again and I channeled it into my Bachelor thesis, leveraging criticism at how global climate governance naturalizes, obscures and perpetuates intergenerational and international injustices in climate visualisations. For behind the veneer of ‘scientificity’ is hidden an unquestioned allegiance to modernism, techno-optimism and capitalism.  It also forecloses any other conceptualisation of the crisis, leaving no point of entry to the non-enfranchised to participate in deliberating pathways towards future co-habitation of Earth. Far from an efficient tool for achieving political change, I began to understand climate science as a rather problematic project of maintaining a violent status quo. I adjusted course, intent on developing my other skillset, graphic design towards the betterment of the world, while maintaining scholarship of critical literature and science philosophy, simply to make sense of the madness. But my mentors in the course I signed up for, the Master’s degree program ‘Transversal Design’ encouraged a critical, but caring look back at environmental system science. Understanding its limitations, there is tremendous potential for developing its strengths towards the ideals I’ve come to embody by learning from different perspectives and personal experience. It is this reconciliatory turn, championing a transversal reconceptualisation of environmental science, that this thesis narrates.</p>

                <p>1. Since 2020 I’ve been a member of the collective, administrating, writing, illustrating, and most significantly formatting the monthly newspaper. The group’s leftist political orientation and horizontal organisation, not to mention each member’s own struggles and efforts continue to inspire, educate and influence my academic endeavors: www.megafon.ch</p>
                <p>2. At the ETH Zürich, environmental system science is differentiated from environmental engineering, though both fall under the rubric of environmental science. Forthwith I will refer to environmental science in general and only to environmental system science when discussing the educational program at the ETH Zürich.</p>

                <p>“Climate politics [has] become revolutionary politics,” Andreas Malm and Wim Carton declare. “[Any] attempt at meaningful mitigation of the crisis would have to waylay the dominant classes with a force and confrontational resolve unlike anything in the common memory or imagination.”<sup>3</sup> The exigency of this revolution is proclaimed among the highest echelons of global environmental governance, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): “Wide-ranging, large-scale, rapid and systemic transformation is now essential to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement [of 1.5°C].”<sup>4</sup> I am writing this thesis against this background, where climate scientists and politicians insist on nothing short of a revolution of the way we inhabit the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the matter of climate, over a million publications<sup>5</sup> have been fashioned in science’s crisp and objective language, working to appear void of personality and story. The assumption is that ‘the facts will speak for themselves’ and that by way of their irrefutable rational rhetoric, they will have a forcing function on politics.<sup>6</sup> This bulwark of research is invaluable for estimating impacts and mitigating disasters. But judged on the basis of fossil investments soaring in recent years,<sup>7</sup> regarding preventative policies the outcome has been “ineffectual,”<sup>8</sup> as some climate scientists themselves lament. Meanwhile, international climate governance is committed to a business-as-usual strategy by way of a green capitalist economic system, entrenching exploitative and objectifying relations to land and people.<sup>9</sup></p>
                <br>
                <p>Nonetheless I believe in the possibility for environmental science to play a part in guiding these essential “root-and-branch transformations.”<sup>10</sup> I agree with James Hansen, renowned climate scientist with decades of experience, when he asserts that “young people […] have faith in science.”<sup>11</sup> But my story as a student of environmental system science gives nuance to this faith, for it is contingent on science’s ability to reorient itself. What sorts of sensibilities need to be curated in environmental science students and practitioners, for them to be able to employ its tools for change responsibly and meaningfully? What is necessary to shift scientific paradigms away from harmful colonial, capitalist, conservative impulses and towards a reflexive, embodied scientific practice; one that is confident yet humble enough to explore new ways of inhabiting our world in collaboration with a vast network of allies from different epistemic traditions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The history of climate science – which I’m treating as a subcategory of environmental science for the purpose of this thesis, assuming significant overlap of their epistemic culture<sup>12</sup> – is replete with hegemonic and violent knowledge structures, which an uncritical environmental science risks reproducing. It is necessary to engage with past problematics, acknowledging that “authentic therapy […] as a prelude to integration and healing […] often involves traumatic encounters.”<sup>13</sup> To this end, part 1 of this thesis sketches a rough outline of critical and historical literature on climate science, delimiting these polluted bonds in order to structure new pedagogies and paradigms that know to be vigilant about them. Part 2 departs for my own accounts of uncanny encounters in the Swiss environmental education and political context, where environmental science is structurally wound up in asserting capitalist realities while foreclosing other possibilities. Part 3, finally seeks reconciliation by taking stock of the tools for changing relations to land and people (to kin), that are already present in scientific practice. I conclude by speculating towards a transversal environmental science.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A note on style: For a matter of such profound concern to everyone, I follow Carolin Emcke in asserting, that it is inexusable to cede meaningful discussion about climate change to scientific fora.<sup>14</sup> Instead she calls for ‘factual storytelling,’ that while still strictly devoted to truthfulness, doesn’t just “recount, understand, reconstruct and document, explain and analyse, but explicitly narrates”<sup>15</sup> climate change, thus leaving space for other possible futures and trajectories. Thus, instead of proclaiming comprehensibility, this thesis attends to the minutiae of addressing the crisis, as an embodied political, social and cultural practice.</p>

                <p>Climate science has for over fifty years been virtually certain of climate change and has published countless papers on the acute imperative for decisive political action. But a long-durée perspective on the discipline of climate science reveals a more troubling history, where one is hard-pressed to thoroughly consider what elements of its antecedent institutional design have bled over into contemporary practice.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>In a recent history of climate science, Jean-Baptiste Fressoz and Fabian Locher<sup>17</sup> conclude, that in its pre-contemporary form spanning from the 1400s up to around 1950, the discipline served as the intellectual arm of empires and nations.<sup>18</sup> For colonists, climate engineering by means of deforestation was a strategy to 'temper' the torrid climates (and with it their peoples), which served as an attractor to other Europeans to help maintain the colonies. The observations, that decimating forest cover did in fact reduce the tropical torrential rains (a bothersome occurrence in the eyes of the colonists) was also instrumented as a sign of divine providence: As if the colonising mission was sanctioned by God.<sup>19</sup> Finally, altering the climate as a product of land-use change also served an ideological purpose. The colonists asserted, that native people had never learned to put the land they lived on to 'good use' like European agriculture or forestry had. Thus they also never truly owned it. And when the colonies in India, the Maghreb and French West Africa later would suffer calamitous famines under colonial rule, the colonists drew on climate science to argue that the natives had brought it on themselves through their forebears’ bad management of the land; so firm was the colonists' stupendously arrogant belief in the superiority of their knowledge and thus their mastery of nature.<sup>20</sup></p>

                <p>For nation states, climate science became an instrument for public appeasement: If the ruling regime could guarantee, that the climate was essentially stable, that a long winter, a rainy summer and ensuing famines, were merely a fluke, then the longterm stability of its regime could be guaranteed as well. It could also be instrumented to sediment new regimes: "Is there a way of repairing a country, <em>a climate</em>?"<sup>21</sup> asked a French revolutionary in 1790, at once unifying both matters into one concern, and indicting the environmental management practices of the just overthrown monarchy. The relationship between national stability, anti-revolutions and nation states persists: In a working paper from 1974 the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency wrote, that "[t]he stability of most nations is based upon a dependable source of food […] but this stability will not be possible under the new climatic era."<sup>22</sup> Matters of national security have always been tightly wound up in the affairs of climate science.</p>

                <p>A review of 21st century climate politics by Malm and Carton<sup>23</sup> reveals the continuation of this impulse, that is more concerned with the maintenance of the status quo than listening to those impacted by poor policy choices. After ratifying the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which defined 2°C as the upper limit for global atmospheric temperatures to rise, the European Union went shopping for strategies to get there.<sup>24</sup> The technology that scientists employed to model such strategies are called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). Different from climate models, IAMs integrate economical formulas with environmental, physical laws, rather than factoring anthropogenic emissions as simply a variable input.<sup>25</sup></p>

                <p>Joshua Howe historicizes climate science’s alignment with economics and its growing importance in the context of the collapse of the Soviet Union: “The triumph of global capitalism at the end of the Cold War helped to establish the unabashed primacy of economics in international climate negotiations […].”<sup>26</sup> Both disciplines relying heavily on data computation and statistics, their outcomes “[…] masked a constellation of moral and political concerns in artificially rational, objective terms.”<sup>27</sup> In IAMs this practice materialized in a set of assumptions about how humans act: Unburdened and undifferentiated by class, race or gender, humanity as a whole was modelled along the unilateral axis of optimum efficiency and profit maximizing: “Only some things can be counted, so only count them.”<sup>28</sup> These assumptions need to be made apparent, interrogated and potentially discarded in favour of more differentiated, nuanced models.

                <p>Tasked with determining optimal climate policy to reach 2°C by the end of the 21st century, various computing groups (notably all based in Europe and North America) soon came to a sobering conclusion: Within prevalent market logic and the state of technological development, it could not be done. But hope in a capitalist future was not lost: Recent research theorized that the efficient removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was possible, utilizing a technology called Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). It proposed planting fast growing, genetically modified crops like sugarcane, poplars, water hyacinths or willows to photosynthecially fix carbon out of the atmosphere. After harvesting, they would then be burned to produce electricity, while the emitted carbon is captured by a filter, that is installed in the chimney. The captured carbon is then buried underground, for instance in a depleted oilfield.<sup>30</sup></p>

                <p>Bewilderingly as it gained relevance in IAMs, this technology and infrastructure was merely a theoretical concept. “At the time of Paris, there was exactly one pilot plant in the whole world, in Illinois.”<sup>31</sup> By contrast, renewable sources of energy were abundant, in fact by the mid 2010s they were already cheaper than fossil fuels, not to mention safer for its workers.<sup>32</sup> While IAMs did explore renewable energy and lifestyle adjustments in their models, what determined the stupendous privileging of undeveloped BECCS technology was the immense appetite for just such a scenario by policy makers. BECCS allowed the modellers to extend the total amount of emittable carbon dioxide significantly beyond the limit, by betting that this technology would ripen in the future and be able to reverse excessive emissions: To overshoot the target. This was music to the ears of anyone, with high stakes in maintaining fossil-based capitalist economies. In essence, it promised them the ability to continue with their dirty business, if not indefinitely then at least for another couple decades. Policy makers gobbled up these IAM models, giving very little note to more realistic, renewable scenarios they were supplied with. From 2007 onward the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – climate science’s foremost authority – began adopting emission-reversal, or overshoot pathways. In the 2015 Paris Agreement delegates from nations particularly at risk from climate change managed to tighten the target to 1.5°C. But given the logic of emit-then-remove, the models could accommodate the new target, albeit not without difficulty. By 2018, when the IPCC published a Special Report on 1.5°C, out of 578 considered emission scenarios, only 10 did not exceed the carbon budget.</p>

                <p>Critics (even from within the modellers’ own ranks) have of course pummeled this policy with a veritable arsenal of thoroughly reasoned arguments. Chiefly, given the dynamic, unpredictable and volatile nature of the climate system, unimpeeded emissions today are bound to sow disastrous environmental conditions for people living in coastal, arid and hot climates as well as future generations. What is destroyed along the overshoot trajectory, cannot be undone by fanciful future technology. But global climate governance’s allegiance to business-as-usual meant that scientific concern and the consolidated voice of nations particularly exposed to sea level rise and heatwaves, played second fiddle to capital and national interests.<sup>33</sup></p>

                <p>When in 1985 and 1987 Mustafa Tolba convened a community of climate scientists to begin etching out climate policy, it was out of profound concern about the future habitability of Earth. Breaking with scientific doctrine to keep its head low in the arena of politics, this community working on a scientific consensus on climate change was intent to "explicitly address not just science but policy."<sup>34</sup> At the time, this was a bold and brave move. It attests both to the exigency scientists felt to act on global warming, and to their optimism about political instruments to act on it. Hot on the heels of the United Nations conventions on Air Pollution in 1979<sup>35</sup> and one of the most successful environmental treaties to this day, the Montreal Protocol in 1987,<sup>36</sup> faith in these types of policy instruments soared high.</p>

                <p>35. The United Nations Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution was proposed in 1979 and was swiftly translated into a national legislation, effectively lowering emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) or nitrogen oxides (NOX) as well as other industrial chemicals and significantly curbing the phenomenon known as acid rain. Howe, 148–49.</p>
                <p>36.  The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer guided a transition away from chlorofluoromethanes (CF2CL2 and CFCL2) and chlorofuorocarbons (CFCs), prevalent in household products like hair sprays. It was spurred on by a very concerned public and an industry readily adopting alternatives to maintain market shares. Howe, 151.</p>

            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>But Tolba's symposia fell under the ire of the United States, where incumbent president Ronald Reagan insisted on a seat at the table. To not squander their hard work, the climate science community agreed to form a new assembly under the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was principled on a consensus-making process in collaboration with the governments responsible for carrying out climate policies. Thus they would have no rational recourse <em>not</em> to act on it.<sup>37</sup></p>

                <p>But instead, this grand institutional instrument for translating pressing scientific concerns about climate into policy devolved into a deranged theatre, where not the polluters were scrutinized, but the quality of scientific evidence. Delegates would often argue for days about the use of specific words or which language to deliberate in. And under the agonizing eminence of industry lobbyists and conservative governments, the resulting reports ended up to err mostly on the side of caution, favouring conservative estimates relative to the general position of the scientific consensus.<sup>38</sup></p>

                <p>Further, as climate policy is a much touchier subject than acid rain or ozone depletion, instead challenging energy and land-use policies, the burden of proof was more substantial. Contrary to a barrage of skeptics decrying unfounded alarmism, a comparison of IPCC predictions from the 1990s to the actual manifestation of climate change instead reveals a systematic bias towards conservative and “least dramatic”<sup>39</sup> estimates. The authors of this review only partly attribute this to general scientific conservativism, factoring in that scientists risk being ostracized for airing politically or emotionally explosive and consequential research conclusions. Particularly othered scientists (such as gendered or racialized people) have had to fend off such unfair allegations.<sup>40</sup> Echoing Fressoz and Locher’s assessment, that climate science was instrumented as a political tool for placating concerned citizens,<sup>41</sup> Brysse et al. argue that particularly earth system science has an a priori skeptical tendency towards consequential implications, frequently invoking “the ‘principle of least astonishment.’”<sup>42</sup> Finally, as regards the design of IPCC visualisations, the long-winded, complicated and tenuous approval process of IPCC reports favours designs that ressemble already approved and published material, prohibiting designers to engage in “visual experiments.”<sup>43</sup></p>

                <p>In lieu of politically salient arguments, IPCC reports then became a jumble of technical jargon and acronyms,<sup>44</sup> producing semantic and semiotic barriers of entry for the non-enfranchised.<sup>45</sup> Together with extremely high expectations towards ‘scientificity,’ the upshot is the centralisation of epistemic authority in an institution that is rigid to change. Alarmingly it now also seems comfortably aligned with fossil fuel interests. The president of negotiations at the 2023 Conference of the Parties<sup>46</sup> in the United Arab Emirates was none other than Sultan Al Jaber, former CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. To skew public opinion about this obvious conflict of interest, members of his team doctored Wikipedia articles and issued a slew of social media posts, arguing that he was “precisely the kind of ally the climate movement needs.”<sup>47</sup> Meanwhile in Europe, as of October 2023 the Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth is former Shell employee Wopke Hoekstra.<sup>48</sup></p>

                <p>46. As confusing as climate policy is made out to be, just so are the intergovernmental bodies responsible for carrying it out. In 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was created, and with it the Conference of the Parties (COP), where Parties to the UNFCCC would meet annually to coordinate the implementation of national climate policies. The IPCC is independent to the UNFCCC, acting as the primary source of information (but explicitly does not prescribe policy) to the UNFCCC and the COP.</p>

                <p>The IPCC’s move towards consolidation of epistemic authority therefore seems the result of both a concentrated effort on behalf of those wishing to postpone policy measures and a stubborn insistence by scientists for what constitutes ‘good science.’ Were the scientists instrumented towards the outcome of an intergovernmental vehicle for achieving climate policy, that is at once locked up in asserting the need for change, while also inherently resistant to it? I dare not say. But the result of deferral, while policymakers debate the quality of scientific facts, certainly does favour those who feared that the IPCC might actually become an effective tool for climate policy.</p>

                <p>Unabated, the IPCC continues its grueling work. I attended a talk at the ETH Zürich on 02.05.2025 by Naomi Oreskes,<sup>49</sup> who has previously argued for the dissolving the IPCC’s Working Group I, whose focus is the ‘physical science basis’ of climate change: There is no need to reassert the reality of climate change. Instead scientists ought to focus their efforts on adaptation and mitigation.<sup>50</sup> Not to mention, the message would be unmissable: Science has done its job. Now it’s time for politics to follow suit. Incidentally, Sonia Severante, Co-Chair of the IPCC’s Working Group I<sup>51</sup> in its seventh assessment cycle (the synthesis report is scheduled for publication in late 2029<sup>52</sup>) was present in the lecture hall. She responded, that this had been a point of discussion. The co-chairs came to the conclusion however, that it was important to continue assessing the current state of climate change, to predict future outcomes and thus provide scientific backing to update policy measures. To me, this speaks to a certain role that the IPCC is capable of, and is indeed very good at – namely collecting and documenting climate knowledge – but also points to its shortcomings, if it is to be the only vehicle for achieving change at the scale that it insists on. I don’t believe that Sonia Severante has any delusions as to the role of the IPCC in achieving the societal upheaval to the degree that is necessary to avoid catastrophic climate outcomes.</p>

                <p>In this spirit, I hope it becomes clear, that while I am leveraging criticism at the IPCC, it’s not so much about the scientists working on it nor the publications it produces. Rather it’s directed at the paradigms, structures and forces at play in international climate governance that deliberately waste time arguing over the quality of evidence, while foisting the IPCC up as the exclusive and only arbiter of climate knowledge. When I call for a larger diversity of scientific research initiatives that are designed to operate on the border to politics, I am not alone: Concluding that the IPCC significantly underestimated the effects of aerosols on climate sensitivity, Hansen et al. assert the need for a complementary approach and alternative perspective on climate concerns, like the impending shutdown of the Atlantic ‘conveyor-belt’ (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) that is still replete with uncertainties.<sup>53</sup></p>

                <p>Data, that murky substance at the heart of climate science, is premised on its essentially objective nature. But as many critical scholars have pointed out,<sup>54</sup> data isn’t just naturally out there waiting to be gathered like blueberries or mushrooms are. Rendering data into maluable scientific substance is a very human process, relying on technologies and instruments of seeing, that make it interpretable by human minds. It is and always was a very subjective practice, a particular way to look at the world. Over the course of history in Western intellectual thought however, the human touch that is inevitable in data collection and its processing into observation and fact, became seen as an “epistemological malady.”<sup>55</sup> Simultaneous with a proliferation of technological possibilities for measuring environments, subjective climate knowledge (such as testimony-based evidence<sup>56</sup>) or imprecise proxies (for example grape harvest dates<sup>57</sup>) became shunned, in favour of numerical data.</p>

                <p>The other event that this proliferation of technological instruments of seeing roughly coincides with, is industrialisation and capitalism. For capitalists, technological possiblities and government/academic institutions championing distancing operations as epistemically virtuous merged into a remarkably convenient set of material and ideological circumstances. As Jason Moore writes, “the great advantage of mapping the world on a grid, and nature as an external object, was that one could appropriate the work of nature in a fashion profoundly efficient for capital accumulation.”<sup>58</sup> Science as a practice of objectification was put to great use in rendering the original substance – be it land, minerals, water or people and their labour – as mere naturally occurring resource. Falling under the settler-colonial paradigm, where knowing the world means determining most efficient and sustainable practices of exploitation, put in service of personal or national interests,<sup>59</sup> everything rendered in terms of mere data becomes potential property.<sup>60</sup> With Kathryn Yusoff's contribution from the field of geology we come to see this impulse finding a relentless continuation in settler-scientific cultures, indiscriminately rendering minerals and bodies alike as mere commodity.<sup>61</sup></p>

                <p>I grew up next to the Aare river in Bern, which springs in the Grimsel region of the Bernese Alps. Surveying that landscape, one comes to see, that it is dominated by infrastructure: Massive concrete walls contour anthropogenic lakes, where the glacial runoff, precipitation and snowmelt accumulates to be channeled through hydroelectric dams to produce electricity without a trace of CO2 (the massive amounts of carbon-dioxide emitted in its construction notwithstanding). Hungrily they feed off of the potential energy once stored in the glaciers, that now as a result of climate change are dwindling, set to vanish entirely within the century. But in the glacial foreland, for millennia hidden under the glacier, now seeing the light of day, an unparalleled display of nature's capacity for renewal is unveiled. The forelands are characterized not just by a diversity of pioneering species that make flatland nutrient-saturated meadows pale in comparison, but also by a richness of habitats in very little space: Within a span of ten meters one travels from sand, to roaring torrents, gentle trickles of water and delicate moss patches sprawling in between massive boulders, that are littered with colourful lichen. As rivers change their course and seasons advance, within just a few weeks, the landscape is completely transformed.<sup>67</sup> Spatially, temporally and in terms of species it is spectacularly diverse and unlike any other that I can relate to.</p>

                <p>"I've never met an ecologist who came to the field for the love of data or for the wonder of a p-value", Potawatomi biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer relates (2020, p. 252). She recalls being enamored by the beauty of Asters and Goldenrods, their aesthetic and ecological harmony compelling her to pursue biology.
                </p>
                <p>When I think back to what drove nineteen-year-old me to sign up for a degree in environmental science, it had nothing to do with beauty or a profound sense of admiration for the world, its abundant gifts and my place in it. In fact, I had only very little sense for the entangled nature of my urban world and the environment; the Cartesian dialectic has inundated Western European thought traditions and structured my worldview even before my academic encounter with it. <em>Nature and culture are separate</em>. And my sense for beauty in the world had nothing to do with saving it.</p>
                <p>Neither were data and p-values driving factors. But I’d soon come to know them as omnipresent and indispensable. Put simply, a p-value is the outcome of a statistical test which measures the likelihood that an observed result cannot be explained by natural variance. The formula spits out a fractional number; the smaller it is, the more significant the result. A p-value lower than 0.05 or 0.01 – conventional significance levels – indicates that one can with a high degree of certainty (but not absolute certainty) accept an alternative hypothesis over the null hypothesis. In short, p-values quantify the reliability of a result. Especially in the science of climate – the discipline is dominated by computational science, the validity of its arguments hinging on statistical certainty – the importance of p-values at the boundary between it and politics cannot be understated.</p>
                <p>Lacking any concept of these tedious truth-making processes, what drove me to environmental science was politics. I found myself in a cultural moment that cultivated in me a fierce sense for the injustices in the world, which climate change would only exacerbate. And so, I felt a calling to pursue a science that would optimally position me to help rebuff the uncertain and unfair world climate change was unleashing.</p>
                <div class="h1">Hammers and Nails</div>
                <p>At the ETH Zürich, the environmental science that I found myself within was one of hammers and nails; problems that can be analyzed and undone with a solution of some variety. The scope commendably extended beyond technological solutionism to facilitating socio-cultural change or devising policy instruments. Rarely challenged, however, is the general premise of business as usual – say, capitalism. Nor is the authority that wields the hammer ever brought into question – say, the primacy of science over other ways of knowing. The dominant paradigms of solutionism paired with optimism is encapsulated in one of the titular lectures of the program: “Environmental problem solving”. A toolkit to right wrongs and reinstitute the status quo.</p>
                <p>Considering the context of the program’s emergence, such a premise makes sense: The department was called into being amidst unprecedented environmental crises. To even begin to address them, disparate scientific disciplines needed to collaborate. 1986: In Chernobyl an explosion blasted radioactive aerosols into the atmosphere which, borne upon the wind, spread over Europe and Western Asia. Closer to home, in Basel a fire at a chemical storage facility led to the spilling of thirty tons of toxic plant pesticides into the Rhine River, poisoning it halfway to Rotterdam (Mieg & Frischknecht, 2014). Overhead the ozone layer was being depleted and rainclouds harboring sulfuric and nitric acids loomed. A transdisciplinary approach, revolutionary for its time, can indeed guide the clean-up of such catastrophes. But what of the wider political and economic circumstances that brought them about to begin with? With climate change, asking those questions has become indispensable for addressing the problem.</p>
                <p>While my classmates (many of which were on the climate strike organizing committees) and I were outside in the streets shouting <em>system change, not climate change</em>, my teachers barely managed to squeeze in a footnote on systemic change. (One, I remember even impressed that we were better off attending a dendrology lecture than a climate strike.) I struggled to find electives in the course catalogue on the matter and when I did, they’d be fully booked already. There was a hunger for a different kind of politics there, but mere crumbs in terms of academic resources to fill it.</p>
                <div class="h1">Good Science, Good Policy?</div>
                <p>I took on environmental science of a mind to understand climate change and thereby contribute to addressing the crisis. The guiding question throughout my academic career soon became, how has it come to this? How have we known about global warming for so long, yet we still seem no closer to overcoming it? Perhaps unsurprisingly, the answer came more from environmental history and critical humanities, than from laboratory speleothem-analysis.</p>
                <p>Already by 1979 climate scientists had reached the consensus, that fossil fuels posed a problem to the stability of Earth's climate. In 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was commissioned to coordinate political efforts globally, but decisive policy measures stalled quickly as governments and industry fought hard to protect their fossil capital (Howe, 2014). In the late 1990s and 2000s climate scientists then found themselves confronted with coordinated efforts to unsettle the quality of evidence (Oreskes & Conway, 2011). And just as climate change started going mainstream, the disastrous notion took hold that the science was unresolved.</p>
                <p>Scientists had relied heavily on computers and statistics as truth-producing engines vis à vis policy makers, making it an easy game for skeptics to point out the ways scientists manipulate the data (Walsh, 2014). These "tricks", unveiled, were leveraged to disqualify scientific evidence. Manipulations are necessary processes along the chain of scientific knowledge production (see for instance Bruno Latour’s (2014) essay "The More Manipulations, the Better"), but nonetheless the damage was done and the bar for what was considered statistically certain raised. But scientists rallied: <em>Rationality backed by good, clean science will prevail.</em></p>
            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>But as Andreas Malm and Wim Carton brutally expound in their recent book "Overshoot", there was never anything rational about climate policy (Malm & Carton, 2024). A bitter pill for reality-based scientists<sup>1</sup> to swallow, good science does in fact not yield good policy. And so, scientists sought to find arguments rooted in a language their irrational adversaries would understand: economics (Howe, 2014). Called on by EU-leaders to determine viable pathways to reach emission targets <em>without significant disruptions to the global order</em>, computer modeling groups located in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and the state of Washington began running the numbers. But they hit a snag: No group was able to simulate a world below 3°C of warming relative to pre-fossil-burning temperatures. Under the imperative to cause as little disruption to the prevailing economic order as possible, it couldn't be done. At least, not without a trick: The Dutch team permitted the model to overshoot the emission targets. Future technologies – theoretical fabulations at that time and for the most part still today – would later be able to remove carbon dioxide, thereby cooling the planet back down to the desired temperature. The science is dubious, the strategy reckless and in utter disregard for the damage done along the way. But armed with the language of science – its graphs and formulas oozing objectivity and truthfulness – adherents to the status quo and their fossil fuel-guzzling friends must have found it easy enough to weaponize this strategy. In spite of ample criticism on behalf of the scientific community, even from the modelers themselves, <em>overshoot</em> is still the determining strategy for climate policy today (Malm & Carton, 2024).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-citations">
                <p>1. ‘Reality-based community’ is a word used by an aid to the Bush administration in 2004 to describe people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” And right-wing actors are more than content to let the reality-based community – I suppose I’d count myself in there too –  study this reality. For while we’re analysing it, they’re plowing on, rending reality and creating it anew. (Suskind, 2004).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>Frustratingly, critical scholars have disambiguated a key concern here long ago: Outlining her concept of planetarity, Gayatri Spivak warned in 2003: "The globe is on our computers. No one lives there. It allows us to think that we can aim to control it” (p. 72). Donna Haraway elucidated more than a decade earlier that science has inserted itself as the voice of nature. Science is “representational practice that <em>forever</em> authorizes the ventriloquist”, meaning the scientist (1992, p. 312, emphasis in original). Their skills and technologies enable the environment, preconceived as mute, to speak. Couched in the complex language of climate policy and the superficial objectivity of statistics, the computer model becomes a means for disqualifying knowledgeable voices of others and implementing itself as the sole authority.</p>
                <div class="h1">Traumatic Encounters</div>
                <p>Now, I want to be careful: While I am taking a critical stance on environmental science, I don't wish to disprove, denounce, disavow or otherwise challenge the knowledge I was taught, nor its teachers, whose patient instruction I'm eternally grateful for. I hold this education fondly in my memory, and it's exactly for that reason that I am devoting my writing and research practice to its betterment. I have no doubt, that on the road to a just, caring world, knowledge of fluid dynamics, atmospheric mixing, Coriolis forces, soil nutrient balance, glacier movements, thermodynamics, computer simulations and yes, even p-values will be indispensable.</p>
                <p>But I tread carefully: There has been plenty malevolent critique of methods and practices, challenges to the quality of scientific evidence. The fossil fuel interests behind these dissensions achieved the desired outcome: Deferral of policy measures and weakened faith in scientific institutions (Oreskes & Conway, 2011). While scientists carry on with a new resolve, espousing ever more revolutionary terms (Malm & Carton, 2024), these epistemic battles are traumatic memories for the discipline (Raman & Pearce, 2020).</p>
                <p>Regarding climate change, swift action on behalf of politicians is indeed called for. But for environmental scientists' hastiness risks foregoing reckoning with the trauma, it has both suffered and caused. Regarding the latter, think only of the discipline's history, dutiful servant to the empire and guarantor of its stability (Fressoz & Locher, 2024). These paradigms and prejudices have etched themselves into climate science’s technologies and procedures, leading well-intentioned practitioners to reproduce past violences. As scholars Lee-Anne Broadhead and Sean Howard warn, "conflict avoidance … is not conflict resolution" (2021, p. 112). It is "…vital to acknowledge that authentic therapy – intended as a prelude to integration and healing – often involves traumatic encounters"(p. 114). What epistemic fortifications were erected that further entrenched climate science's exclusive claim to epistemic authority? What other ways of knowing, and thus ways of worlding, were marginalized even further? Especially now, as we begrudgingly must accept that science alone doesn’t translate into policy, plural epistemologies like Robin Wall Kimmerer's need space on the increasingly bewildering stage (Emcke, 2024; Malm & Carton, 2024) of climate politics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>The question I began my studies of environmental science comes into sight again: How come the danger of climate change has been apparent for so long and yet progress towards its resolution stifles and stumbles with little regard for the casualties along the way? To even begin answering this question, I needed to expand my language beyond the vernacular of natural science. As I enrich it with the careful and critical scholarship of history, politics and social science, a transversal language comes into view, that also knows to speak with and listen to <em>others</em>; those plants, planets and people, that are <em>othered</em> in the language of science. In the company of super-critical-science-lovers<sup>2</sup> and with my former professors and colleagues in mind, but also the land I live on and people I live with, I take on the task of care-fully prodding at environmental science and climate science in specific, intent on helping my peers devise pathways qualified not just by arithmetic, but a rich plurality of knowledge bearers. After all, it’s not for the love of p-values that scientists love what they do.</p>

                <p>2. This phrase Femke Snelting resonated with me. At a workshop called “Loose Energy Curriculum: Grow Your Own Solar Panels”, she employed it to position herself critically but not mistrustingly towards science in general. The workshop was a part of the exhibition “Energy Giveaway at the Humuspunk Library” in 2023 at the We Are AIA Gallery in Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
