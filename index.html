                <p>For the exhibition <a href="https://transversaldesign.ch/iridescence">Iridescence – A Spectrum of Research Practices</a> from September 10.–14. 2025, I produced an A3 riso print, which folds into an eight page zine. Outlined therein are the corner-points of my research for the thesis Speculating Towards a Transversal Environmental Science. On the back is a poster, consisting of a 48 frame animation of a spinning globe. The exhibition featured a table with the riso-prints, a print-out of the thesis “Speculating Towards a Transversal Environmental Science,” and other related printed matter, a wall projection of the animated, spinning globe and three prints mounted on the wall.
The printed poster formed the foundation of a workshop that occurred on September 13. 2025, where interested participants gathered around the table to draw and paint over the apocalyptic landscape depicted in the climate graphics, adding blues and greens to represent a future worth living in and fighting for.</p>

                <h1>Opportunities and Contingencies for a Reorientation of Environmental Science Towards Kin and Community</h1>
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                <p>While the threat of climate change has been scientifically understood for over fifty years, fossil investments and emissions continue climbing, jeopardizing progress towards renewable economies or lifestyle adjustments. For just as long, feminist and critical theorists have insisted on a situated perspective in science, to combat ‘objective’ scientific conclusions being put to work for naturalising and reproducing violent regimes and relations to the world. In the context of climate change, situated and reflexive paradigms are important for learning to inhabit the world on principles of care and kinship. But climate policy continues to insist on ‘pure’, objective science, in doing so denying the relevance of different relations to the world. The author reflects on the lack of such sensibilities in his environmental system science education, and speculates towards a transversal environmental science paradigm on the principles of embodiment, curiosity, humility and responsibility.</p>

                <h1>Preface: Fury Between Academia and Activism</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>When I began my academic education seven years ago, what I brought with me was fury: I was angry over the state of the world. I had learned of the multifaceted injustices that national and global governing regimes perpetuate in the context of my work with the megafon newspaper collective<sup>1</sup> and left political activism in Bern, Switzerland; climate justice, antifascism, migrant solidarity, BLM, women's rights, Rojava. Though my privileged upbringing and white-masculine appearance shielded me from experiencing much of it first-hand, I was raised with humility and tenderness, which instilled in me the importance of solidarity and the possibility for achieving a better world.
                </p>
                <p>I was socialized in a political landscape that championed science as the exclusive basis for rational decision-making. Thus, intent on making a positive difference with regard to climate change, I signed up for the environmental system science<sup>2</sup> curriculum at the ETH Zürich. I believed it would supply me with the proper tools to encounter this world, ripe with inequality and injustice while environmental devastation looms for all earthlings on the fast approaching horizon.
                </p>
                <p>This education was very formative and instructive, but it also profoundly confused my political passion: Politics had little space in analytical, natural science after all. My classmates, I gather, were in a similar place. We would skip classes in favour of going to climate strikes, only to return to the library late and catch up on class. It is not that the institute for environmental system science wasn't welcoming of this political action: On the contrary, the atrium of the environmental system science building was often the site for painting strike banners and drawing signs. Nonetheless, I remember my suspicions over the doctrinaire division of science and politics in the curriculum; the imperative was to appear pure and value-neutral, even as we all had no illusions about why we were studying environmental system science.
                <br><br>
                After three semesters of regimented schedule consisting almost exclusively of natural science classes, the possibility to sign up for electives made available new lenses for understanding what was going on. In the ETH Zürich's humanities department I found a critical language for investigating my suspicions; one that aligned much better with my embodied, activist knowledge and facilitated an interrogation of the natural science that I once looked up to for answers. With it I found my fury again and I channeled it into my Bachelor thesis, leveraging criticism at how global climate governance naturalizes, obscures and perpetuates intergenerational and international injustices in climate visualisations. For behind the veneer of ‘scientificity’ is hidden an unquestioned allegiance to modernism, techno-optimism and capitalism.  It also forecloses any other conceptualisation of the crisis, leaving no point of entry to the non-enfranchised to participate in deliberating pathways towards future co-habitation of Earth. Far from an efficient tool for achieving political change, I began to understand climate science as a rather problematic project of maintaining a violent status quo.
                    <br><br>
                    I adjusted course, intent on developing my other skillset, graphic design towards the betterment of the world, while maintaining scholarship of critical literature and science philosophy, simply to make sense of the madness. But my mentors in the course I signed up for, the Master’s degree program ‘Transversal Design’ encouraged a critical, but caring look back at environmental system science. Understanding its limitations, there is tremendous potential for developing its strengths towards the ideals I’ve come to embody by learning from different perspectives and personal experience. It is this reconciliatory turn, championing a transversal reconceptualisation of environmental science, that this thesis narrates.

                <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <div class="pf-i-c-citations">
                <p>1. Since 2020 I’ve been a member of the collective, administrating, writing, illustrating, and most significantly formatting the monthly newspaper. The group’s leftist political orientation and horizontal organisation, not to mention each member’s own struggles and efforts continue to inspire, educate and influence my academic endeavors: www.megafon.ch</p>
                <p>2. At the ETH Zürich, environmental system science is differentiated from environmental engineering, though both fall under the rubric of environmental science. Forthwith I will refer to environmental science in general and only to environmental system science when discussing the educational program at the ETH Zürich.</p>

            <div class="pf-i-c-body">
                <p>“Climate politics [has] become revolutionary politics,” Andreas Malm and Wim Carton declare. “[Any] attempt at meaningful mitigation of the crisis would have to waylay the dominant classes with a force and confrontational resolve unlike anything in the common memory or imagination.”<sup>3</sup> The exigency of this revolution is proclaimed among the highest echelons of global environmental governance, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): “Wide-ranging, large-scale, rapid and systemic transformation is now essential to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement [of 1.5°C].”<sup>4</sup> I am writing this thesis against this background, where climate scientists and politicians insist on nothing short of a revolution of the way we inhabit the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the matter of climate, over a million publications<sup>5</sup> have been fashioned in science’s crisp and objective language, working to appear void of personality and story. The assumption is that ‘the facts will speak for themselves’ and that by way of their irrefutable rational rhetoric, they will have a forcing function on politics.<sup>6</sup> This bulwark of research is invaluable for estimating impacts and mitigating disasters. But judged on the basis of fossil investments soaring in recent years,<sup>7</sup> regarding preventative policies the outcome has been “ineffectual,”<sup>8</sup> as some climate scientists themselves lament. Meanwhile, international climate governance is committed to a business-as-usual strategy by way of a green capitalist economic system, entrenching exploitative and objectifying relations to land and people.<sup>9</sup></p>
                <br>
                <p>Nonetheless I believe in the possibility for environmental science to play a part in guiding these essential “root-and-branch transformations.”<sup>10</sup> I agree with James Hansen, renowned climate scientist with decades of experience, when he asserts that “young people […] have faith in science.”<sup>11</sup> But my story as a student of environmental system science gives nuance to this faith, for it is contingent on science’s ability to reorient itself. What sorts of sensibilities need to be curated in environmental science students and practitioners, for them to be able to employ its tools for change responsibly and meaningfully? What is necessary to shift scientific paradigms away from harmful colonial, capitalist, conservative impulses and towards a reflexive, embodied scientific practice; one that is confident yet humble enough to explore new ways of inhabiting our world in collaboration with a vast network of allies from different epistemic traditions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The history of climate science – which I’m treating as a subcategory of environmental science for the purpose of this thesis, assuming significant overlap of their epistemic culture<sup>12</sup> – is replete with hegemonic and violent knowledge structures, which an uncritical environmental science risks reproducing. It is necessary to engage with past problematics, acknowledging that “authentic therapy […] as a prelude to integration and healing […] often involves traumatic encounters.”<sup>13</sup> To this end, part 1 of this thesis sketches a rough outline of critical and historical literature on climate science, delimiting these polluted bonds in order to structure new pedagogies and paradigms that know to be vigilant about them. Part 2 departs for my own accounts of uncanny encounters in the Swiss environmental education and political context, where environmental science is structurally wound up in asserting capitalist realities while foreclosing other possibilities. Part 3, finally seeks reconciliation by taking stock of the tools for changing relations to land and people (to kin), that are already present in scientific practice. I conclude by speculating towards a transversal environmental science.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A note on style: For a matter of such profound concern to everyone, I follow Carolin Emcke in asserting, that it is inexusable to cede meaningful discussion about climate change to scientific fora.<sup>14</sup> Instead she calls for ‘factual storytelling,’ that while still strictly devoted to truthfulness, doesn’t just “recount, understand, reconstruct and document, explain and analyse, but explicitly narrates”<sup>15</sup> climate change, thus leaving space for other possible futures and trajectories. Thus, instead of proclaiming comprehensibility, this thesis attends to the minutiae of addressing the crisis, as an embodied political, social and cultural practice.</p>
